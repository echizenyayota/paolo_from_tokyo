https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdiWTYkY1uY

### A 0:00 - 0:03

So in this video I'm goona show you guys what it's like to work in a Japanese office.

### B 0:24 - 0:28

This is Emmy.a 24 years old Japanese woman working in Tokyo.And she is just waking up.

### C 0:35 - 0:45

This is the morning routine.She doesn't take a shower to ready for works as some may assume.Like many Japanese she prefer taking a bath  in the evening before she goes to work instead.

### D 0:54 - 0:56

Emi,how long dose it take to put on your makeup?

### E 1:16 - 1:18

Nice spread! Who made breakfast for you?

### F 1:26 - 1:35

Well...and we completely bailed on breakfast.It's ok though she's trying to be on time. In fact many Japanese grab a small breakfast like an "onigiri" from the convinience store on the way to work. 

### G 1:37 - 1:44

So, if you didn't notice already, Emi still lives if her family which is the fairly common thing in Japan, even after graduating from university.

### H 1:45 - 2:07

Emi commutes to work by train but the closes tansition from her house is about ten minute walk.The average of commute time in Tokyo is about forty minutes to an hour.

An hour train riding in the morning sounds a bitlong,but Emi's quite lucky as she doesn't have to transit like others.

So this is the train right now. It's arriving. such a long long ride.

### I 2:20 - 2:25

So Emi's office is located in Otemachi area which is considered Tokyo's premier business district. She works at one of the largest called Pasona.

### J 2:26 - 2:36

One of the largest stuffing sevice companies in Japan. Therse's about four thousands stuffs in her office alone and about nine tousands are total worldwide. Is this building only Pasona people? 

### K 2:49 - 3:06

You don’t have a monitor?And that’s Emi’s boss, super friendly.And this is the Emi’s office. As you can see,very open and colorful compared most of Japanese offices.

### L 3:07 - 3:24

Since Emi works in the PR department her first task of the day is to read all the newspapers. So she's up to the speed of what's going on in Japan and rest of the world.And today’s Monday.

She has to catch up on all the news over the weekend.So she is in a bit of a rush.Check out this view outside. It’s pretty dope.

### M 3:25 - 3:37

Is everyone here doing the same job? How are people seated in the office?

### N 3:38 - 3:51

So check this out.This happens often in Japnese offices.This lady is passing out to souvenir sweets from her summer vacation. It's called "Omiyage" in Japanese. It's customary in Japan to bring something back from your vacation for people in the office.

- 座らせる　seat他動詞：transitive verb, 
- 座る：sit自動詞：intransitive verb

### O 3:52 - 4:02

It's a kind of a way to show graditude others for letting you take a break from work and for them covering you while you're away.Oh and there's another person doing it.In my fifteen plus years in Japan I've never seen anyone forget to do this.

- See someone do(原型不定詞)

### P 4:03 - 4:12 

So one thing I'm really noticing is just how quiet this the office is.There are not a lot of loud voices which I guess when working in a work space like this,where it's all open.It's very very helpful.

### Q 4:13 - 4:25
 
Literally it's like actually fairly respectable. Not a lot of people are talking or grabbing, you can actually get work done here because no one's too loud. People actually don't wear the headphones.In my preivious office, I used to wear headphones but that was probably just me.

### R 4:26 - 4:39

But I've actually noticed something interesting. I don't know it's something worldwide.There was a desk with a little humidifier on it. Is that something just Japan, or does the rest of the world where like people have humidfiers on the desk because the air is too dry?

### S 4:42 - 4:54

So what I'm showing you right now is the company's morning assembly meeting. In Japan it's called "CHOREI" and it takes place every morning.

I'm kind of surprised that Emi's company still does this, being as progressive as they are .As you see this more commonly practiced in all traditional Japanese companies.
