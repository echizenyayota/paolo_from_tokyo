### A 0:00 - 0:03

So in this video I'm goona show you guys what it's like to work in a Japanese office.

### B 0:24 - 0:28

This is Emmy.a 24 years old Japanese woman working in Tokyo.And she is just waking up.

### C 0:35 - 0:45

This is the morning routine.She doesn't take a shower to ready for works as some may assume.Like many Japanese she prefer taking a bath  in the evening before she goes to work instead.

### D 0:54 - 0:56

Emi,how long dose it take to put on your makeup?

### E 1:16 - 1:18

Nice spread! Who made breakfast for you?

### F 1:26 - 1:35

Well...and we completely bailed on breakfast.It's ok though she's trying to be on time. In fact many Japanese grab a small breakfast like an "onigiri" from the convinience store on the way to work. 

### G 1:37 - 1:44

So you didn't notice already, Emi is resided with the family which is the fairly common in Japan even after graduating the university.

### H 1:45 - 2:07

Emi commutes to work by train but closed to the station from her house by ten minute walk.The average of commute time in Tokyo is about forty five minutes to an hour.

An hour train riding in the morning sounds be long.But Emi is quite lucky.She doesn't need to transfer to the trains like others.

So this is the train riding now. It's arriving. such as, long long riding.

### I 2:20 - 2:25

So Emi's office is located in Otemachi area which is considered in the Tokyo of a few business streets. She works at the company which is called Pasona.

### J 2:26 - 2:36

One of them are the largest stuff sevicing companies in Japan. It has about four thousands stuffs to work at the office alone.The about nine tousands are totaled worldwide. Is this building only Pasona people?
