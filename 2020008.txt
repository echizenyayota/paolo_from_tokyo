### A 0:00 - 0:03

So in this video I'm goona show you guys what it's like to work in a Japanese office.

### B 0:24 - 0:28

This is Emmy.a 24 years old Japanese woman working in Tokyo.And she is just waking up.

### C 0:35 - 0:45

This is the morning routine.She doesn't take a shower to ready for works as some may assume.Like many Japanese she prefer taking a bath  in the evening before she goes to work instead.

### D 0:54 - 0:56

Emi,how long dose it take to put on your makeup?

### E 1:16 - 1:18

Nice spread! Who made breakfast for you?

### F 1:26 - 1:35

Well...and we completely bailed on breakfast.It's ok though she's trying to be on time. In fact many Japanese grab a small breakfast like an "onigiri" from the convinience store on the way to work. 

### G 1:37 - 1:44

So, if you didn't notice already, Emi still lives if her family which is the fairly common thing in Japan, even after graduating from university.

### H 1:45 - 2:07

Emi commutes to work by train but the closes tansition from her house is about ten minute walk.The average of commute time in Tokyo is about forty minutes to an hour.

An hour train riding in the morning sounds a bitlong,but Emi's quite lucky as she doesn't have to transit like others.

So this is the train right now. It's arriving. such a long long ride.

### I 2:20 - 2:25

So Emi's office is located in Otemachi area which is considered Tokyo's premier business district. She works at one of the largest called Pasona.

### J 2:26 - 2:36

One of the largest stuffing sevice companies in Japan. Therse's about four thousands stuffs in her office alone and about nine tousands are total worldwide. Is this building only Pasona people?
