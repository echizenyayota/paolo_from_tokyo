Emi,how long dose it take to put on your makeup?

Nice spread! Who made breakfast for you?

### F 1:26 - 1:35

### G 1:37 - 1:44

So, if you didn't notice already, Emi still lives if her family which is the fairly common thing in Japan, even after graduating from university.

### H 1:45 - 2:07

Emi commutes to work by train but the closes tansition from her house is about ten minute walk.The average of commute time in Tokyo is about forty minutes to an hour.

An hour train riding in the morning sounds a bitlong,but Emi's quite lucky as she doesn't have to transit like others.

You don’t have a monitor?And that’s Emi’s boss, super friendly.And this is the Emi’s office. As you can see,very open and colorful compared most of Japanese offices.

### L 3:07 - 3:24

Since Emi works in the PR department her first task of the day is to read all the newspapers. So she's up to the speed of what's going on in Japan and rest of the world.And today’s Monday.

She has to catch up on all the news over the weekend.So she is in a bit of a rush.Check out this view outside. It’s pretty dope.

### M 3:25 - 3:37

Is everyone here doing the same job? How are people's seats in the office?
